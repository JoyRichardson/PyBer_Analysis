# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
PyBer is a ridesharing app for which we have been asked to perform exploratory analysis on the data to showcase the relationships between the city types by drivers and riders as well as the percentage of fares by drivers and riders in each city type.  With our analysis and visualizations, management will determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods and improve access to rideshare services.
## Resources
Data:  .csv files:  city_data, ride_data<br/>
Software(s):  Python 3.7, Jupyter Lab 3.0.14, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
## Results
As demonstrated in the line chart below, approximately 65% of total fares are earned in urban cities, with 30% in suburban and only 5% in rural cities.

Accordingly, the total number of rides and the average number of drivers mirror the fare percentages in each city type. We have included the following summary table to support our findings.
